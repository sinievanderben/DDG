# Ship ML experiment 
Two versions are provided: a Jupyter Notebook and a few related Python scripts.

In the Jupyter Notebook, the process of analysing the data is explained more clearly and shows the reason for certain choices. I opted for a notebook because you can divide the process in chunks. This project is a small project with different steps which makes it suited for a notebook to easily explore small chances in the process. The Python collection of scripts is a sum of the process of the Jupyter notebook. 

Both the notebook and the files work with the same environment.yml file, which creates a conda environment called 'ddg'.
